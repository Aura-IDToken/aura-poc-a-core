# Project docs

This directory contains formal specifications, design docs, and reference material.

Top-level directories:
- /core — PoCA math & logic (proofs, algorithms, experiments)
- /audit — Merkle / hash proofs, audit tooling and test vectors
- /compliance — JSON / PDF schemas, compliance artifacts and mappings
- /docs — Formal specs, API documentation, RFCs

Suggested next steps:
1. Add a short README in each directory describing intended substructure (e.g., /core/algorithms, /core/tests).
2. Add CI checks to validate schemas in /compliance and proof tests in /audit.
3. If you want, I can push these placeholders and the README to a repo — tell me the owner/name and branch to use.
